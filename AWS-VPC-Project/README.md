## 📁 Project 1: AWS VPC Network Setup

In this project, I designed and deployed a fully secure Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) architecture across multiple Availability Zones. This foundational networking setup includes:

* **Multi-AZ VPC** configuration for high availability
* **Public and Private Subnets** split across two Availability Zones
* **Internet Gateway** for controlled ingress/egress
* **NAT Gateway** to allow private instances secure outbound access
* **Bastion Host (Jump Box)** for secure administrative access to private EC2 instances
* **Route Tables & Security Groups** designed with the principle of least privilege

This architecture provides a production-ready network environment suitable for secure workloads and scalable applications.
