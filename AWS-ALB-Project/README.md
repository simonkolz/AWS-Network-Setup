## 📁 Project 2: Application Load Balancer Deployment

This project focuses on deploying an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** to distribute traffic across EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones.

Key components include:

* **ALB spanning multiple subnets** for fault tolerance
* **Target Groups** routing traffic to EC2 instances
* **Health Checks** for automatic detection of unhealthy instances
* **Security Groups** ensuring controlled, secure traffic flow
* **Auto Scaling compatibility** for future expansion if needed

The result is a highly available, resilient, and secure load-balanced web architecture.
